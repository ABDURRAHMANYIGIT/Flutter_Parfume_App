# Flutter Parfume App Exercise

This is my Flutter Parfume App exercise. 
Founded the design on Dribbble and trying to clone it to improve my layouting and programming skills. I gonna build the project responsive and compatible with design patterns. I'll also try hard to write clean code. I will update the README file throughout the process.

## Day 1
I started the project. Created AppBar, bottomNavigationBar and icons. Then created TextField and customize it (hint text, search icon, fill the inside of Field etc.) Lastly i created a custom widget named MenuBar (If you mind to check it out you can find it in [here](https://github.com/ABDURRAHMANYIGIT/Flutter_Parfume_App/blob/master/lib/pages/menu_bar.dart)) and used it inside of Listview.builder. Instead of manually adding elements to the list, I created a more useful architecture in this way so that it does not cause difficulties in the next designs.

## Day 2
I created a white container. I also worked on the part where the perfumes are shown, but it doesn't look like the referenced design as you can see below, I will continue to work tomorrow
